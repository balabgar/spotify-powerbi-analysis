# Spotify Listening Analysis with Power BI

This project analyzes Spotify listening data to uncover insights about user behavior, top tracks and artists, and listening patterns across days and hours. It was built in Power BI, using DAX for calculations and a clear data model to enable filtering by platform, shuffle, and skipped status.

## Repository Structure

* `Images/`: Screenshots of the dashboards for a quick look.
* `Presentation/`: A summary deck highlighting the approach and insights.
* `Data_Sample/`: A small sample of the dataset (anonymized) for reference.

## Tools

* Power BI Desktop
* DAX
